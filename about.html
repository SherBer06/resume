        <p>I'm Sherrie. A married mid-30 year old mom of three. Life is funny sometimes
            but I think the most important things I've learned in life have come from experiences.
            My husband and I built a house. A freaking house. It was a strong, well planned, beautiful home.
            No contractor. Just us. It was AWESOME and we learned so much working together. It was so challenging
            but we loved every minute....minus the 15 where we fought over where the pendant
            lights should hang. </p>
        <p>Although building a home was fun, our greatest accomplishments are our
            three kids. Two boys and one girl. Our daughter has a rare genetic disease
            called Cystic Fibrosis. She was diagnosed at 10 days old and since then, she's had
            thousands of hours of therapy and even more doses of medications. Too many
            doctor visits, hospital visits and labs to count. She is our little hero and her older
            brothers are our champions. They are awesome kids! </p>
        <p>Most importantly is what I've
            learned from her diagnosis and the juggling act that has followed. Balancing life while
            managing the circus that has become our lives takes creativity and grit. I've always
            loved organizing (like since I was 3) and I really enjoy problem solving. I'm a hard
            worker and like to get things done. My worst quality is that I don't like to ask
            for help. I'm definitely up for a challenge and can't wait to see where
            this new life in the tech world will take me.
